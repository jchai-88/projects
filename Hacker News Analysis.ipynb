    "The data set that we'll work with can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts). It is important to note that this data set has been reduced from almost 300 000 rows to approximately 20 000 rows. This is done by firstly filtering out the summissions that did not receive any comments. Thereafer, random sampling was used to select data from the remaining submissions.\n",
